This is similar to the&nbsp;Pioneer DEH-4300UB, but only has a single 2V pre-out and can't change display colors. They are otherwise the same, with full control of iPod or iPhone controls when connected through the front USB port. Other portable devices can be connected through the 3.5mm AUX input, and files can be read from a burned CD or USB storage device in MP3, WMA, WAV and AAC formats. An Advanced Sound Retriever works to fill in gaps left in compressed audio, making it sound more rich and detailed. Audio is sent to the speakers on 4 channels at 50 watts each.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>CD Receiver</li>\n    <li>Front USB Port for Direct Control of iPod/iPhone or Access to USB Device</li>\n    <li>Advanced Sound Retriever for Compressed Audio Enhancement</li>\n    <li>1 RCA Preouts (2V)</li>\n    <li>24 Stations / 6 Presets</li>\n    <li>MOSFET 50 W x 4</li>\n    <li>3-Band Parametric Equalizer</li>\n    <li>2 mode Loudness</li>\n    <li>MP3/WMA/WAV/AAC Playback</li>\n    <li>CD-R/RW Compatible</li>\n    <li>AUX input</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"57","number_of_reviews":"1","category":"A/V Head Units","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"can easily see the screen on a sunny day","id":"90054","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"controls are easy to work with while you're driving, very comfortable","id":"90057","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"reads through the contents of a USB thumb drive quickly","id":"90058","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"installation and configuration is very easy","id":"90059","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"screen is too bright at night, a bit distracting and can't adjust","id":"90053","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"doesn't have a high-pass filter, gets distortion on some speakers at high volume","id":"90055","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"no support for AAC files if not played directly from an iPod","id":"90056","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Pioneer DEH-3300UB","upc":"884938116084","mpn":"DEH-3300UB","asin":"B004BLJXLQ","ean":"084938116088"}]}]}
