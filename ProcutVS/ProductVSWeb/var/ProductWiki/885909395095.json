This is the 4th generation of the Apple iPod Touch, and includes two cameras, one on either side of the device. This allows video conferencing and messaging over a Wi-Fi connection. Also new to this version is a 3.5 inch Retina display, which shows images at 326 pixels per inch to create more detail than the eye can pick up. Local maps are also now available but the Touch still lacks a GPS receiver, allowing quick directions from many locations. Connections to the App Store and iTunes can run through a standard Wi-Fi connection, and a Bluetooth connection allows for additional functionality and backups. Email and web browsing is fully supported, as well as browsing YouTube. Video display can be as detailed as the high-definition 720p standard.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>FaceTime with 2 cameras (new)</li>\n    <li>3.5 in Retina display, 960 x 640 pixels (new, 326 pixels per inch)</li>\n    <li>HD Video Recording</li>\n    <li>802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.1 &amp; EDR connectivity</li>\n    <li>Movies &amp; TV shows, up to 720p 30 frames per second, MP4, M-JPEG</li>\n    <li>8 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB memory</li>\n    <li>App Store, iTunes access</li>\n    <li>Mail, Safari web browser, YouTube</li>\n    <li>Photos</li>\n    <li>Voice Control</li>\n    <li>Maps</li>\n    <li>Voice Memos</li>\n    <li>Headphones included</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"76","number_of_reviews":"20","category":"Internet Media Tablets","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"super high resolution 'Retina' display -
