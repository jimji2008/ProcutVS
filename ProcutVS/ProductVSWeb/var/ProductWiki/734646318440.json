It offers ultra-fast printing and copying speeds up to 30ppm and 25cpm, in addition to high-quality 1200x2400 dpi scans and fast standalone faxing. It&rsquo;s in fact the only unit in the entire series to offer faxing. Unfortunately it lacks some of the convenience features on its superior siblings, such as an automatic duplexing and a touchscreen display. There is however an automatic document feeder, but it&rsquo;s a rather low capacity one. Also included are USB and SD card slots, versatile compatibility (both PCs and Macs), and a 5000 duty cycle.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>All-in-One HP Thermal Inkjet Printer</li>\n    <li>Print, Scan, Copy Functionalities</li>\n    <li>Maximum 33ppm Black Print</li>\n    <li>Maximum 30ppm Color Print</li>\n    <li>Maximum 25cpm Black Copy</li>\n    <li>Maximum 21cpm Color Copy</li>\n    <li>Maximum 1200x2400dpi, 48-bit Scan</li>\n    <li>Duty Cycle Up to 5000 Pages/Month</li>\n    <li>2-Line LCD Display</li>\n    <li>ADF Input Tray &ndash; 35 Sheets</li>\n    <li>ASF Input Tray &ndash; 100 Sheets</li>\n    <li>ADF Output Tray &ndash; 35 Pages</li>\n    <li>ASF Output Tray &ndash; 25</li>\n    <li>Manual 2-Sided Printing</li>\n    <li>USB Connectivity w/PictBridge</li>\n    <li>802.11b/g Wireless Networking</li>\n    <li>SD/SDHC/MMC Card Slot</li>\n    <li>Windows/Macintosh Compatibility</li>\n    <li>1-Year Limited Warranty</li>\n    <li>2-Year Extended Limited Warranty (Registration Required)</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"22","number_of_reviews":"1","category":"Printers","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"easy to setup and configure","id":"88240","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"printed color photos look good","id":"88246","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"if one individual ink cartridge runs out, the entire printer will stop working","id":"88238","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"paper jams can be very difficult to clear ","id":"88239","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"inefficient - uses lots of ink ","id":"88241","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"the automatic feeder works inconsistently ","id":"88242","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"poor wireless reception - the printer needs to be relatively close to the base station ","id":"88243","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"poor documentation - the included manual isn't very useful when it comes to troubleshooting common printing errors ","id":"88244","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"the required ink cartridges are expensive ","id":"88245","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Lexmark Interpret S405","upc":"734646318440","mpn":"90T4005","asin":"B002TNCC20","ean":"734646291293"},{"title":"Lexmark Interpret S405","upc":"734646318440","mpn":"InterpretS405","asin":"B002E9CAZI","ean":"734646291293"}]},{"url":"http://www.productwiki.com/lexmark-interpret-s405/","id":47185,"title":"Lexmark Interpret S405","description":"<p>The Lexmark Impact S405 is a wireless, all-in-one inkjet printer designed for printing, copying, scanning, and faxing documents.
