This camera's Face Detection feature detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp portraits. The iAuto mode of the Cyber-shot DSC-W530 recognizes scenes, lighting conditions and faces, and adjusts settings accordingly for clear images. The 2.7 inch LCD display (230K pixels) allows you to compose photos and view photos, as well as view menus. The Cyber-shot DSC-W530's 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer. This lens is 26mm equivalent wide-angle, which allows for group shots in tight spots. The PHOTOMUSIC feature combines images with music (4 tracks, 5 minutes per track) to produce slide shows with visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, or Stylish).  The Cyber-shot DSC-W530's  Sweep Panorama mode allows you to just press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction for a panoramic capture. When you do this the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment. This camera differs from the lower cost Cyber-shot DSC-W510 in it has a 14.1 megapixel sensor (instead of the Cyber-shot DSC-W510's 12.1 megapixel sensor, for images with more detail and contrast in up to 13x19&quot; prints) and a high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens (as opposed to a Sony lens). This model differs from the higher cost Cyber-shot DSC-W560 model in that the Cyber-shot DSC-W560 has a three inch display and 720p HD Movie Mode, which captures video in 1280 x 720 at 30fps (as opposed to the Cyber-shot DSC-W530's 480p AVI movie mode, which captures 640x480 movies at 30fps).
