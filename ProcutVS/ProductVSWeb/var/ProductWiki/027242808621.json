This camera's 720p HD Movie Mode captures video in 1280 x 720 at 30fps. The Cyber-shot DSC-W570's Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. This camera's SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. The Cyber-shot DSC-W570's Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for lifelike images. The lens of this camera is 25mm equivalent wide-angle, which allows for group shots in tight spots.   The iAuto mode of the Cyber-shot DSC-W570 recognizes scenes, lighting conditions and faces, and adjusts settings accordingly. This camera differs from the lower cost Cyber-shot DSC-W560 model in that it has a 16.1 megapixel sensor (instead of 14.1 megapixels) and a 5x optical zoom (instead of 4x), though its LCD display is only 2.7 inches (the Cyber-shot DSC-W560's is three inches).

Sony promotes the W line of cameras as some of its most affordable, full-featured point-and-shoot cameras to date. The 12.1 megapixel sensor of the Cyber-shot DSC-W510 captures images with contrast and detail, up to 13x19&quot; prints. This camera's 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer. This lens is 26mm equivalent wide-angle, which allows for group shots in tight spots. The 2.7 inch LCD display (230K pixels) allows you to compose photos and view photos, as well as view menus. The Cyber-shot DSC-W510's Sweep Panorama mode allows you to just press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction for a panoramic capture. When you do this the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment. The PHOTOMUSIC feature combines images with music (4 tracks, 5 minutes per track) to produce slide shows with visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, or Stylish). This camera differs from the higher cost Cyber-shot DSC-W530 in that the Cyber-shot DSC-W530 has a 14.1 megapixel sensor (for even more detail and contrast) and a high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens.
