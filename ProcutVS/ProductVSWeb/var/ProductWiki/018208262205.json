This is designed at taking candid shots and home movies for casual photographers, with a number of functions aimed at making pictures look better automatically under a variety of conditions. Motion detection adjusts the camera settings if the subject is moving, and Subject Tracking ensures that the focus remains on the moving target. A Smile Timer releases the shutter when a smile is detected, and a number of in-camera editing options like red eye removal and Quick Retouch help to make subjects look better. The camera can be set for continuous shooting, and it can automatically compare up to 10 shots to automatically find the best one. The&nbsp;12.1 megapixel sensor works well in a variety of low light conditions, and can capture video in full 1080p high definition quality. The lens shifts with the movement of the camera to reduce distortions due to camera shake.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor</li>\n    <li>10x Optical Zoom</li>\n    <li>HD 1080p Video</li>\n    <li>3 in color display</li>\n    <li>Optical VR Image Stabilization</li>\n    <li>Motion Detection</li>\n    <li>High ISO up to 3200</li>\n    <li>Best Shot Selector (BSS)</li>\n    <li>Scene modes</li>\n    <li>In-camera editing: Quick Retouch, D-Lighting, Brightness, Saturation, Color, Red-Eye Fix</li>\n    <li>5 shots per second at full resolution</li>\n    <li>Continuous Shooting</li>\n    <li>Slow Motion Video up to 240 fps</li>\n    <li>Subject tracking</li>\n    <li>Smile Timer, Blink Warning</li>\n    <li>Face-Priority AF</li>\n    <li>HDMI output</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Color Options</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Black</li>\n    <li>Red</li>\n    <li>Gold</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"88","number_of_reviews":"2","category":"Digital Cameras","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"image quality of still photos is great for this camera style","id":"62107","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"1080p video recording - improved over the S8000's 720p mode","id":"62108","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"optical zoom functions as expected, allows extreme close-ups","id":"62109","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"auto-focus is very quick to find the subject","id":"62110","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Face detection is reliable and fast","id":"62111","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"image stabilization works well even while using extreme zoom","id":"62114","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"10x optical zoom","id":"82650","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"10fps continuous shooting up to 5 shots at full resolution","id":"82651","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"3\" high resolution display - 921k dot","id":"82652","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"optical image stabilization","id":"82653","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"HDMI output - for direct playback of images and videos on compatible HDTVs and displays","id":"82654","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"10MP BSI CMOS sensor - improved low light shooting over previous generations of point and shoot sensors","id":"82655","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"records to easy to find, affordable and capacious SD/SDHC memory cards","id":"82656","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"flash is positioned where one might naturally grip the camera","id":"62112","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"doesn't ship with an SD card","id":"62113","score":"0","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Nikon Coolpix S8100 | Black","upc":"018208262199","mpn":"S8100Black","asin":"B00427ZLS8","ean":"018208262199"},{"title":"Nikon Coolpix S8100 | Red","upc":"018208262205","mpn":"S8100Red","asin":"B00427ZLSS","ean":"018208262205"},{"title":"Nikon Coolpix S8100 | Gold","upc":"018208262212","mpn":"S8100Gold","asin":"B00427ZLTC","ean":"018208262212"}]}]}
