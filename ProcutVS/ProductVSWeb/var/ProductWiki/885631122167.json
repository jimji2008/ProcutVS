It&rsquo;s a bit more expensive than the HP Photosmart Plus B210a, but it still remains budget-friendly. In particular, the only difference is higher speeds, the incorporation of automatic duplexing, and a much larger touchscreen display. Like its counterpart, the device can be accessed by any network computer via integrated 802.11b/g/n connectivity. Plus if it&rsquo;s installed in an office infrastructure defined by the Blackberry Enterprise Server, it can be accessed by any Internet- and email-capable BlackBerry smartphone OS 4.5.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Print, Copy, Scan, Fax, Web</li>\n    <li>Up to 33 / 32ppm Black/Color Print</li>\n    <li>Up to 600x600 / 9600x2400 Color Resolution</li>\n    <li>Up to 1200dpi Scanner Resolution (24-Bit)</li>\n    <li>Up to 30 / 32cpm Copy Speed</li>\n    <li>4.3&quot; Color Graphic Touchscreen Display</li>\n    <li>Automatic Duplex</li>\n    <li>Borderless Printing up to 8.5x11&quot;</li>\n    <li>Direct Photo Printing (Memory Cards, PictBridge)</li>\n    <li>125-Sheet Input Tray</li>\n    <li>20-Sheet Photo Tray</li>\n    <li>USB/WiFi Connectivity</li>\n    <li>Memory Card Support</li>\n    <li>ePrint Functionality</li>\n    <li>Integrated Templates</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"50","number_of_reviews":"3","category":"Printers","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"photo printing - produces colorful and detailed pictures","id":"83868","score":"3","submitter":false},{"text":"B&W print quality - operates quickly and produces good results on multipurpose paper","id":"83873","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"great for mobile devices - features easy wireless and Internet printing","id":"83870","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"quiet - doesn't make too much noise","id":"83872","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"slick aesthetic","id":"96659","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"auto-duplex printing","id":"96662","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"multi-funcition: print, copy, scan and fax","id":"96669","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"ePrint functionality - allows you to print from any device, from anywhere, just by sending your print job to the device's dedicated e-mail address","id":"96679","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"touchscreen build quality - tends to develop a colored tint and various other display issues","id":"83866","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"lacks Ethernet connectivity - doesn't supported wired network printing","id":"83875","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"setup - some users will have difficulty getting network printing to work properly","id":"83871","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"might not work correctly when plugged into a surge protector","id":"83874","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"no PictBridge compatibility","id":"96660","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"no automatic document feeder - you must scan / copy each individual page manually","id":"96666","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"touchscreen interface is slow and unresponsive","id":"96670","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"apps system is flawed - too slow and annoying to use when you probably have a much faster, easier to use computer nearby","id":"96675","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"no manual button controls - forced to use the touchscreen for everything","id":"96686","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"HP Photosmart Premium C310a","upc":"885631122167","mpn":"CN503AB1H","asin":"B003YTATLO","ean":"885631122167"}]}]}
