The lens of this camera is 25mm wide angle. This lens allows you to take wide shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces. With 10x optical zoom, you can take detailed shots from far away. The HD Movie Mode of this camera shoots 720p video in 1280 x 720 high definition movies at 30 fps. The 16.1 megapixel sensor of this camera will capture images with detail and contrast in prints up to 13x16&quot;. The Cyber-shot DSC-H70's three inch LCD touchscreen allows for easy focus selection and photo viewing. This camera's SteadyShot image stabilization feature, common on Sony digital shooters, uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur. The Cyber-shot DSC-H70's Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for images that are lifelike. This camera has a Motion Detection feature that  adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected in a picture, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces. There are color options available for the Cyber-shot DSC-H70 digital camera. </p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Color options</li>\n    <li>16.1MP sensor</li>\n    <li>3&quot; LCD touchscreen</li>\n    <li>HD Movie Mode (720p)</li>\n    <li>TransferJet technology</li>\n    <li>Creative painting tools</li>\n    <li>Includes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.5</li>\n    <li>Includes Sony PMB Portable software</li>\n    <li>Anti-blink function</li>\n    <li>Sweep Panorama mode</li>\n    <li>iAuto mode</li>\n    <li>25mm lens</li>\n    <li>10x optical zoom lens</li>\n    <li>Soft Skin mode</li>\n    <li>In-camera guide</li>\n    <li>Motion Detection</li>\n    <li>High Sensitivity mode (3200 ISO)</li>\n    <li>Intelligent Scene Recognition mode</li>\n    <li>SteadyShot image stabilization</li>\n    <li>Natural Flash mode</li>\n    <li>Smile Shutter technology</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Color Options</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Black</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Silver</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Blue</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Red</strong></li>\n</ul>","proscore":"56","number_of_reviews":"4","category":"Digital Cameras","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"available in several different colors - something for everyone","id":"96133","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"lots of optical zoom (10x) - great for getting in close","id":"96134","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"easy to use - great for novice photographers ","id":"96136","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"rechargeable battery system - doesn't rely on disposable AAs","id":"96138","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"includes many photo enhancement features - good for those looking to improve their shots","id":"96139","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"unique Sweep Panorama Mode","id":"96140","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"affordable price for a nice point and shoot with decent zoom lens from Sony","id":"101790","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"records to either SD/SDHC/SDXC or Sony's Memory Stick Pro Duo flash storage","id":"101792","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"great image quality for what it is","id":"101793","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"the much nicer HX7V is worth saving up for","id":"101796","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"not full HD compliant - only records video in 720p","id":"96135","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"manufacturer warranty - only 1 year","id":"96137","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"slow lens - F/3.5-5.5, poorer shooting experience in low light, not capable of any depth of field effect","id":"101791","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"standard low resolution display (230K dot)","id":"101794","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"plain no-frills aesthetic","id":"101795","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H70 | Silver","upc":"027242808683","mpn":"DSCH70","asin":"B004H8FNEO","ean":"027242808683"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H70 | Blue","upc":"027242808713","mpn":"DSCH70/L","asin":"B004H8FNF8","ean":"027242808713"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H70 | Black","upc":"027242808690","mpn":"DSCH70/B","asin":"B004H8FNEE","ean":"027242808690"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H70 | Red","upc":"027242808706","mpn":"DSCH70/R","asin":"B004H8FNEY","ean":"027242808706"}]}]}
