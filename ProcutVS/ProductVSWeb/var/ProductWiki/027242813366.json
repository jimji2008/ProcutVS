The 16.1 megapixel sensor of this camera will capture images with detail and contrast in prints up to 13x16&quot;. The Cyber-shot DSC-T110's three inch LCD touchscreen allows for easy focus selection and photo viewing. The high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer. This lens is 25mm wide angle, and allows you to take wide shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces. The Cyber-shot DSC-T110's SteadyShot image stabilization feature uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. The HD Movie Mode shoots 720p video in 1280 x 720 high definition at 30 fps. The Cyber-shot DSC-T110's Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for images that are lifelike. This camera's Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. There are color options available for the Cyber-shot DSC-T110 digital camera.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Color options</li>\n    <li>16.1MP sensor</li>\n    <li>3&quot; LCD touchscreen</li>\n    <li>HD Movie Mode (720p)</li>\n    <li>TransferJet technology</li>\n    <li>Creative painting tools</li>\n    <li>Includes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.5</li>\n    <li>Includes Sony PMB Portable software</li>\n    <li>Anti-blink function</li>\n    <li>Sweep Panorama mode</li>\n    <li>iAuto mode</li>\n    <li>Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 25mm lens</li>\n    <li>4x optical zoom lens</li>\n    <li>Soft Skin mode</li>\n    <li>In-camera guide</li>\n    <li>Motion detection</li>\n    <li>High Sensitivity mode (3200 ISO)</li>\n    <li>Intelligent Scene Recognition mode</li>\n    <li>SteadyShot image stabilization</li>\n    <li>Natural Flash mode</li>\n    <li>Smile Shutter technology</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Color Options</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Black</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Silver</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Pink</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Violet</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Red</strong></li>\n</ul>","proscore":"71","number_of_reviews":"1","category":"Digital Cameras","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"Slim enough to fit in a pocket or purse easily.","id":"103804","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Image quality is above average for the price point.","id":"103805","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Decent low-light shooting with low image noise up to and including ISO 800.","id":"103806","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Touchscreen is responsive and easy to use.","id":"103807","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"User interface is attractive and well thought out.","id":"103808","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"3-inch LCD only shows 2.5-inch window when shooting at full resolution.","id":"103809","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Image taking is a bit slow compared to similar competing models.","id":"103810","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T110 | Black","upc":"027242813366","mpn":"DSCT110/B","asin":"B004H8FNI0","ean":"027242813366"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T110 | Silver","upc":"027242813359","mpn":"DSCT110","asin":"B004H8FNHQ","ean":"027242813359"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T110 | Pink","upc":"027242813373","mpn":"DSCT110/P","asin":"B004H8FNIA","ean":"027242813373"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T110 | Violet","upc":"027242813397","mpn":"DSCT110/V","asin":"B004H8FNIU","ean":"027242813397"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T110 | Red","upc":"027242813380","mpn":"DSCT110/R","asin":"B004H8FNIK","ean":"027242813380"}]}]}
