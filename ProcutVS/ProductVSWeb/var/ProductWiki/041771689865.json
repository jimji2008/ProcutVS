It upgrades from the M522 ever so slightly by hosting a bit more compact and chic frame with more stylish color options. Otherwise it&rsquo;s the exact same product, in that the core specifications remain the same. Some of these include a 4MP sensor, a 4x optical zoom lens, and a 2.7&rdquo; display. There&rsquo;s also a USB interface for PC connectivity, and the Kodak Share function for tagging photos and videos for uploading to a social network. There are also a multitude of functions for improving photo and video quality.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Compact Digital Camera</li>\n    <li>14MP Sensor</li>\n    <li>28mm Wide-Angle 4x Optical Zoom</li>\n    <li>2.7&quot; LCD Display</li>\n    <li>HD Still Image Capture</li>\n    <li>720p Video Capture</li>\n    <li>One-Touch Record</li>\n    <li>Smart Capture</li>\n    <li>Face Recognition</li>\n    <li>Multiple Scene/Artistic Modes</li>\n    <li>Image Stabilization</li>\n    <li>Scene/Art Effects</li>\n    <li>Kodak Share</li>\n    <li>Li-Ion Battery</li>\n    <li>USB AC Adapter</li>\n    <li>Wrist Strap</li>\n    <li>USB Cable</li>\n    <li>Windows/Mac</li>\n    <li>1-Year Warranty</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Color Variations</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Kodak EasyShare M532 Silver | 8377129</li>\n    <li>Kodak EasyShare M532 Red | 1689868&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>Kodak EasyShare M532 Green | 8790750&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>Kodak EasyShare M532 Blue | 8909186</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"75","number_of_reviews":"1","category":"Digital Cameras","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"interface is completely point-and-shoot, very simple","id":"100279","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"compact enough to fit into a pants pocket comfortably","id":"100280","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"LCD is large, clear, and easy to see if you've captured the subject","id":"100281","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"image stabilization completely accounts for a little shaking from handheld photography","id":"100282","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"pictures come out sharp, high-quality and big","id":"100285","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"good performance in low light, fairly low noise","id":"100286","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"battery doesn't last very long before it needs replacing","id":"100283","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"flash isn't very powerful, need to be reasonably close to the subject","id":"100284","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Kodak EasyShare M532 | Silver","upc":"041778377123","mpn":"8377129","asin":"B004FLL54U","ean":"041778377123"},{"title":"Kodak EasyShare M532 | Blue","upc":"041778909188","mpn":"8909186","asin":"B004FLL55O","ean":"041778909188"},{"title":"Kodak EasyShare M532 | Red","upc":"041771689865","mpn":"1689868","asin":"B004FLL554","ean":"041771689865"},{"title":"Kodak EasyShare M532 | Green","upc":"041778790755","mpn":"8790750","asin":"B004FLL55E","ean":"041778790755"}]}]}
