Utilizing a super-lightweight design for true portability, this model is available in both White (gloss White exterior, matte Silver interior) and Titan Silver (matte Silver exterior, matte Silver interior) color schemes. Users can choose between a standard WiFi-only model and a hybrid WiFi/World-Mode 3G model, with a $70 difference in price between the two. The computer is fitted with a 12.1-inch SuperBright LED display, and is powered by an Intel Atom N570 processor for high-speed operations. Intel promises boot-up times of less than 10 seconds via &quot;Instant Boot technology&quot;, with multiple on-screen and keyboard components included specifically for Google's Chrome operating system. Samsung's own PowerPlus technology helps to maximize battery life and offers up to 8.5 hours on a single charge, with a 16-gigabyte solid state drive included for increased safety over the user's files and applications. The Series 5 Chromebook also features a 4-in-1 card reader and a pair of USB 2.0 ports for external device connectivity.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Available in White and Titan Silver color options&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>Ultra-thin, lightweight design&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>SuperBright 12.1-inch LED display&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>Available in WiFi-only and WiFi/3G (Verizon) models</li>\n    <li>Intel ATOM N570 processor&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>Instant On boot-up technology</li>\n    <li>2GB Standard System Memory&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>160-gigabyte solid state drive with mSATA</li>\n    <li>DDR3 memory standard&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>16:10 asect ratio&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"81","number_of_reviews":"1","category":"Netbooks","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"available WiFi only version","id":"105515","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"3G connectivity option with 100MB of complementary connectivity, affordable plans from $10 unlimited day passes, $20 for 1GB, $35 for 3GB, $50 for 5GB","id":"105516","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"16:10 aspect ratio display - a lot nicer for vertically oriented content than the new 16:9 standard (websites, documents, etc...)","id":"105517","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"slick minimalist aesthetic","id":"105518","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"affordable $400 price point","id":"105519","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"solid build","id":"105520","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"lightweight at 3.3 pounds","id":"105525","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"beautiful chiclet style keyboard without any noticeable flex, interesting user-friendly keyboard redesign","id":"105526","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"beautiful 12.1\" 1280 x 800px, 300-nit display with matte finish, impressive viewing angles","id":"105528","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"large multitouch trackpad","id":"105529","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"12.1\" design is ideal for use on the go without the cramped display or keyboard of a 10\" netbook","id":"105531","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Chrome OS - simple to use, turns on instantly, does what you need it to do","id":"105533","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"amazing battery life - over 8 hours of standard use","id":"105538","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"all plastic design","id":"105522","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"annoying buttonless trackpad has a narrow clicking area - mistakes a lot of right clicks for left ones","id":"105530","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Chrome OS can't be used like a full OS like Windows, OSX or Linux - far from as powerful as a dedicated laptop for the demanding power user","id":"105536","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Samsung Series 5 ChromeBook | 3G - Silver","upc":"036725733503","mpn":"XE500C21H02US","asin":"B004Z6NU70","ean":"036725733503"},{"title":"Samsung Series 5 ChromeBook | 3G - White","upc":"036725733473","mpn":"XE500C21H01US","asin":"B004Z6NWAU","ean":"036725733473"},{"title":"Samsung Series 5 ChromeBook | WiFi - Silver","upc":"036725733510","mpn":"XE500C21A03US","asin":"B004Z6NRIC","ean":"036725733510"},{"title":"Samsung Series 5 ChromeBook | WiFi - White","upc":"036725733428","mpn":"XE500C21A01US","asin":"B004Z6NV4C","ean":"036725733428"}]}]}
