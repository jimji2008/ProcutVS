The main selling point of this camera is its 36x optical zoom, which dwarfs the zoom of most cameras in its price range and size (including the closely related P300, which has an optical zoom of 4.2x). This zoom is ideal for sporting events and wildlife photography, where the subject is often at a distance. This lens has 22.5 mm wide-angle to 810 mm super-telephoto coverage. This camera is capable of continuous shooting at eight frames per second, which is a feature shared with the P300 model. The 12.1 megapixel CMOS sensor, which helps you to capture subjects in light and dark, is another feature shared between the two models. On the video side of things, both the Coolpix P500 and P300 can capture 1080p HD video with stereo sound.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>36x optical zoom</li>\n    <li>Color options</li>\n    <li>3&quot; 921k-dot Clear Color Display</li>\n    <li>12.1MP CMOS sensor</li>\n    <li>EXPEED C2 Image Processing Engine</li>\n    <li>High-speed continuous shooting at approx. 8 fps</li>\n    <li>Advanced multi-exposure composite image functions </li>\n    <li>360&deg;/180&deg; Easy Panorama mode</li>\n    <li>Slow and fast motion movie recording</li>\n    <li>1080p HD capturing</li>\n    <li>Night Portrait mode</li>\n    <li>Backlighting mode</li>\n    <li>Night Landscape</li>\n    <li>4 exposure modes</li>\n    <li>f/3.4-5.7 lens</li>\n    <li>Hi Speed USB interface</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Color Options</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Red</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Black</strong></li>\n</ul>","proscore":"59","number_of_reviews":"2","category":"Digital Cameras","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"huge 36x zoom - 21.5-800mm equivalent, a massive improvement over the previous generation (26x zoom)","id":"97508","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"high quality 3\" LCD display (921K dot)","id":"97509","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"records to easy to find, affordable, and capacious SD/SDHC/SDXC flash memory cards","id":"97510","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"electronic viewfinder - for when glare or bright light makes using the LCD difficult","id":"97512","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"respectable lens design - no glaring weaknesses: good distortion control, decent sharpness across the frame","id":"97515","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"records video in full 1080p/30 high definition","id":"97516","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"fast performance - quick from turning on to shooting (just over a second), very little shutter lag","id":"97518","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"compact build considering the long lens","id":"97520","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"mini-HDMI output - playback images and video directly onto a compatible display or HDTV","id":"97522","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"no RAW format support","id":"97511","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"longer lens is slow (F/3.4-5.7), poorer in low light","id":"97517","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"lacks direct controls for secondary manual settings such as ISO and white balance","id":"97513","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"standard point and shoot image quality - nothing special due to its nicer-than-average design / specifications","id":"97514","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"battery life is lacking","id":"97521","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[{"url":"http://www.productwiki.com/nikon-coolpix-p300/","id":57445,"title":"Nikon Coolpix P300","description":"<p>The Nikon Coolpix P300 is a mid-cost digital camera. In promotion, Nikon emphasizes the fact that this camera is equipped with manual controls, so that you have creative capturing options. The four exposure modes are: Programmed Auto (P), Shutter-priority (S), Aperture-priority (A) and Manual (M). No matter what mode you choose, the images are captured with this camera's 12.1 megapixel back illuminated CMOS image sensor, which can capture scenes in bright daylight or atmospheric dimness. Thanks to the CMOS sensor, high-quality (300dpi) prints can be made in poster size from this camera. On the video side of things, this camera is capable of capturing 1080p HD video with stereo sound at the press of a button. Though this model differs from the higher cost Coolpix P500 in a variety of ways, the most conspicuous way is in its optical zoom, where its 4.2x is dwarfed by the Coolpix P500's 36x. </p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Color: <strong>Black</strong></li>\n    <li>3&quot; 921k-dot Clear Color Display</li>\n    <li>12.1MP CMOS sensor</li>\n    <li>4 exposure modes</li>\n    <li>EXPEED C2 Image Processing Engine</li>\n    <li>High-speed continuous shooting at approx. 8 fps</li>\n    <li>Advanced multi-exposure composite image functions</li>\n    <li>360&deg;/180&deg; Easy Panorama mode</li>\n    <li>Slow and fast motion movie recording</li>\n    <li>Creative slider for easy image adjustment while shooting</li>\n    <li>Filter effects (in playback)</li>\n    <li>1080p HD capturing</li>\n    <li>Night Portrait mode</li>\n    <li>Backlighting mode</li>\n    <li>4.2x optical zoom</li>\n    <li>Night Landscape</li>\n    <li>Soft/Low key/Sepia/High key modes</li>\n    <li>f/1.8 lens</li>\n    <li>Hi Speed USB interface<br />\n    &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"83","number_of_reviews":"1","category":null,"key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"optically stabilized 4.2x optical zoom (24-100mm equivalent)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"relatively bright lens (F/1.8-4.9) - capable in lower light, can isolate subjects with DOF","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"records video in full 1080p high definition with stereo audio","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"high quality 3\" display (920k dot)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"small and lightweight - easily pocketable","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"solid magnesium-alloy construction","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"8fps continuous shooting up to 7 frames","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"minimalist, somewhat retro aesthetic","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"HDMI port - playback recorded video and images onto a compatible display / HDTV","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"records to easy to find, affordable and capacious SD/SDHC/SDXC flash storage cards","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"no RAW format support","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"small 1/2.3\" sensor - less impressive than competing cameras, has noise introduced at ISO 400","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false}]},"reviews":null,"tags":null,"competitors":null,"related":null,"skus":null}],"skus":[{"title":"Nikon Coolpix P500 | Black","upc":"018208262564","mpn":"P500BLACK","asin":"B004M8SVHK","ean":"018208262564"},{"title":"Nikon Coolpix P500 | Red","upc":"018208262571","mpn":"P500RED","asin":"B004M8SVHU","ean":"018208262571"}]}]}
