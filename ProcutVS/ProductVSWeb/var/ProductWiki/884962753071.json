One of the features of the D110a heavily promoted by HP is the ePrint feature, which allows you to e-mail printing jobs directly to your printer. The integrated wireless of the D110a allows you to print off of smartphones and Wi-Fi-enabled PCs.&nbsp;With the touch of one button, the&nbsp;D110a is set up for wireless printing.&nbsp;Photo printing is&nbsp;the priority with the Photosmart line, and HP&nbsp;emphasizes the fact that the D110a prints&nbsp;lab-quality photos consistently. When you use the recommended&nbsp;Advanced Photo Paper, HP ensures that&nbsp;you will&nbsp;get smudge-free photos&nbsp;that will last a long time.&nbsp;If you have an internet connection to your printer, you can utilize HP's Photo Creations software, which allows you to edit your photos. With the Touchsmart frame, you can print online content without a PC (as long as you have an internet connection). The Touchsmart frame also allows you to access HP's Quick Form templates, which help you to create calenders, checklists and cover pages.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Photo printing</li>\n    <li>Scan</li>\n    <li>Copy</li>\n    <li>ePrint</li>\n    <li>Integrated wireless</li>\n    <li>Photo Creations software</li>\n    <li>Quick Form templates</li>\n    <li>Touchsmart frame</li>\n    <li>High-capacity ink cartridges</li>\n    <li>Easy wireless printing set-up</li>\n    <li>Energy Star qualified</li>\n    <li>Reusable tote bag</li>\n    <li>One-year warranty</li>\n    <li>Power supply</li>\n    <li>Power cord</li>\n    <li>Accessory bag</li>\n    <li>HP 60 ink cartridges: Black, Tri-color</li>\n    <li>Software CD</li>\n    <li>Reference guide</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"67","number_of_reviews":"1","category":"Printers","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"first printer to support HP's new ePrint technology - allows users to print common format files (PDF, JPEG, MS Office documents) via e-mail","id":"54794","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"multi-function - print, scan and copy","id":"54800","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"attractive aesthetic","id":"54801","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"easy to set up","id":"54802","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"includes 100 sheets of photo printer","id":"54804","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"comes with full size ink cartridges","id":"54806","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"web connectivity with many nice online features","id":"54808","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"wireless connectivity - can be placed anywhere in wireless range without the need for an online PC host for network printing","id":"54809","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"affordable price point","id":"54798","score":"0","submitter":false},{"text":"comes in a reusable bag","id":"54805","score":"0","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"noisy","id":"54799","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"very glossy plastic lid - picks up fingerprints easily","id":"54803","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"single colour cartridge needs to be replaced if you run out of a colour - even if you have plenty of the other two left","id":"54807","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"touch buttons don't line up with the options on the display","id":"54810","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"deceptive marketing - ePrint technology is not implemented yet, has no set release date","id":"54795","score":"0","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"HP Photosmart D110a","upc":"884962753071","mpn":"CN731AB1H","asin":"B003JME93K","ean":"884962753071"}]}]}
