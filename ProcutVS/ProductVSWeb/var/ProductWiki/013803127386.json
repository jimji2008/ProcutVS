It is equipped with a 12.1 Mega Pixels CCD sensor, optical image stabiliser, and Canon's Digic 4 image processor. The SX130IS might not be the slimmest compact camera on the market but it differentiates itself from other models with it's 12x optical zoom which can be used during HD video capture which is rare for compact cameras. Like other consumer level Canon digital camers, the SX130 IS offers several &quot;scene&quot; modes which includes miniature effect for movie and fisheye effect for still photos. It has auto focus and face detection functions as well as a 3.0'' TFT colour display. Unlike many cameras the SX130 IS uses AA batteries which contribute to it's large size but it also means that replacement batteries can be easily found.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Features / Specifications</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>12.1 Mega picels CCD sensor</li>\n    <li>12x optical zoom, 4x digital zoom</li>\n    <li>TTL Auto Focus</li>\n    <li>3.0'' TFT colour display</li>\n    <li>f/3.4 - f/5.6</li>\n    <li>Auto, ISO 80/100/200/400/800/1600 equivalent</li>\n    <li>Built in flash</li>\n    <li>SD / SDHC / SDXC</li>\n    <li>USB2.0, HTSC/PAL</li>\n    <li>Dimensions (W x H x D):&nbsp;4.46 x 2.88 x 1.80 in.
