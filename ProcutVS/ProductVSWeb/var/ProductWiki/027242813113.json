It is the only unit in the series that is waterproof to 16&rsquo;, shockproof up to 5&rsquo;, and even dustproof &amp; freeze-proof. Featured is a 16.2MP CMOS sensor, a 4x optical zoom lens, and a 3&rdquo; touchscreen display. More importantly, the DSC-TX10 can capture 3D still images up to 4608x3456 in JPEG, and 2D 1080/60i videos in AVCHD/MP4/MPEG-4, and stereo audio in AAC. Additional features include 10fps burst shooting, and Background Defocus, an HDMI interface, and a DSLR-type function wherein the subject can be emphasized by blurring the background.</p>\n<h2>Additional Information</h2>\n<p>All five models (DSC-TX10, DSC-TX100V, DSC-HX7V, DSC-WX10, DSC-WX9) use a single lens and imager to produce 3D still images. They do this by taking two consecutive pictures in different focus positions. These images are then combined to create a 3D effect.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>16.2MP Exmor R CMOS Sensor</li>\n    <li>Waterproof/Shockrpoof/Dustproof/Freezeproofe</li>\n    <li>4x Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Optical Zoom Lens</li>\n    <li>3D Still Images</li>\n    <li>3D Sweep Panorama</li>\n    <li>Full 1080/60i HD Video</li>\n    <li>3&quot; Touchscreen Display</li>\n    <li>Superior Auto Mode</li>\n    <li>Smile Shutter</li>\n    <li>Auto-Blink</li>\n    <li>Backround Correction</li>\n    <li>Background Defocus</li>\n    <li>Natural Flash</li>\n    <li>Face Detection</li>\n    <li>SD/SDHC/SDXC Expansion</li>\n    <li>USB Rechargeable Battery</li>\n    <li>HDMI Interface</li>\n    <li>Picture Motion Browser (PMB)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Model Variations</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10/B | Black</li>\n    <li>Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10/S | Silver</li>\n    <li>Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10/G | Green</li>\n    <li>Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10/L | Blue</li>\n    <li>Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10/P | Pink</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"77","number_of_reviews":"3","category":"Digital Cameras","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"latest generation \"Exmor R\" back-illuminated CMOS sensor - above average low light performance, little noise (visible grain)","id":"98930","score":"3","submitter":false},{"text":"slim and compact, fits in a purse or pocket","id":"98933","score":"3","submitter":false},{"text":"easy to learn, can just hand it to someone and they can use it right away","id":"98927","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"pictures are generally very sharp and clear in most situations","id":"98928","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"image stabilization completely accounts for hand shake, no need for a tripod or an elbow rest","id":"98931","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"available in multiple colours: blue, black, green, pink, silver","id":"104466","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"ruggedized design - waterproof, freezeproof, dustproof and shockproof","id":"104467","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"full 1080p video recording capability with stereo audio","id":"104468","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"great build quality and design - metal body with protective sliding mechanism, turns the camera on and exposes the lens","id":"104469","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"slick aesthetics","id":"104470","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"records to easy to find SD/SDHC storage as well as Sony's proprietary Memory Stick Pro Duo","id":"104471","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"3\" touchscreen display with high 921.6k dot resolution","id":"104472","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"tends to go through batteries fairly quickly","id":"98934","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"no GPS","id":"104473","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"lens is nothing special - 4x optical zoom, f/3.5 maximum aperture","id":"104474","score":"2","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10 | Black","upc":"027242813120","mpn":"DSCTX10B","asin":"B004H8FNGM","ean":"027242813120"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10 | Green","upc":"027242813137","mpn":"DSCTX10/G","asin":"B004H8FNGW","ean":"027242813137"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10 | Silver","upc":"027242813113","mpn":"DSCTX10","asin":"B004H8FNGC","ean":"027242813113"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10 | Pink","upc":"027242813106","mpn":"DSCTX10/P","asin":"B004H8FNHG","ean":"027242813106"},{"title":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX10 | Blue","upc":"027242813090","mpn":"DSCTX10/L","asin":"B004H8FNH6","ean":"027242813090"}]}]}
