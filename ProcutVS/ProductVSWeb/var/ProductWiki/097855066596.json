The M510 uses laser technology, but lacks the advanced DPI engine option that comes with the 518. Regardless, the M510, like its weaker optical counterpart (the M310) hosts a full-size, contoured design with soft rubber grips that feel more comfortable to the hand, especially after many hours of use. And it too relies on a nano USB receiver to wireless transmit signals to and from a PC. However, the M510 adds along programmable controls in addition to back/forward buttons. This means users can engage in side-to-side scrolling, zoom in/out, etc. Additional features include a battery light indicator and a two-year battery life.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Entry-Level Wireless Mouse</li>\n    <li>Laser Precision Tracking Technology</li>\n    <li>Full-Size, Contoured Design</li>\n    <li>Comfortable to Hands</li>\n    <li>Advanced 2.4GHz Wireless Technology</li>\n    <li>Low-Battery Indicator</li>\n    <li>On/Off Switch</li>\n    <li>USB Transceiver</li>\n    <li>Programmable Controls</li>\n    <li>Back/Forward Buttons</li>\n    <li>Side-to-Side scrolling</li>\n    <li>Two-Year Battery Life</li>\n    <li>3-Year Limited Warranty</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Part Number: PN 910-001822</li>\n    <li>Compatibility: XP, Vista, 7, Mac, Linux</li>\n    <li>Connectivity: USB</li>\n    <li>Battery: 2 AA</li>\n    <li>Warranty: 3-Year</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"90","number_of_reviews":"4","category":"Mice","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"Above-average battery life (2 years on 2 AA batteries).","id":"62488","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"Low-profile wireless USB transmitter can be left in and forgotten.","id":"62490","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"True \"plug 'n' play\" installation, requires no setup.","id":"62493","score":"2","submitter":false},{"text":"Full size appropriate for larger hands.","id":"62487","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Customizable side buttons are useful and stay out of the way of regular use.","id":"62491","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Very accurate laser technology suitable for more delicate tasks.","id":"62489","score":"0","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"Stiff scroll wheel can be tiring over long periods of use.","id":"62492","score":"-2","submitter":false},{"text":"Innacurate and jerky pointer movement.","id":"89826","score":"-2","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Logitech M510","upc":"097855066596","mpn":"910001822","asin":"B003NR57BY","ean":"097855066596"}]}]}
