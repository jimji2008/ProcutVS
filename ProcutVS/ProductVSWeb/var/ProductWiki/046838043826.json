The front auxiliary input of the KD-R320 allows you to get playback from external devices like MP3 players (since this unit lacks the iPod compatibility of the other models in this series). No matter what source your audio is coming from, you can adjust your settings with three-band iEQ. The high pass filter of the KD-R320 helps to ensure that your car speakers (which connect to this unit's MOS-FET amplifier) will not be overloaded with frequencies they cannot handle. This model differs from the higher cost KD-R520 model in that the KD-R520 has a front USB connection for the iPod/iPhone (providing two-way iPod/iPhone control and charging). The JVC KD-R320 car CD receiver has a dedicated subwoofer control, which allows you to get the bass sound you are looking for.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Front auxiliary input</li>\n    <li>6 station hard key presets</li>\n    <li>Bluetooth ready (w/ KS-BTA100 Bluetooth adapter)</li>\n    <li>High pass filter</li>\n    <li>Intelligent beep tones</li>\n    <li>Brightness control that adjusts brightness in 32 steps</li>\n    <li>MOS-FET 50 watts x 4</li>\n    <li>3-band iEQ, loudness</li>\n    <li>Subwoofer control</li>\n    <li>Wireless key chain remote</li>\n    <li>AM/FM tuner</li>\n    <li>24-bit Audio DAC</li>\n    <li>Loudness Control</li>\n    <li>Balance/Fader Control</li>\n    <li>Detachable Faceplate</li>\n    <li>Beep Tone Support (From Speakers)</li>\n    <li>COMPU PLAY</li>\n    <li>Rotary Encoder</li>\n    <li>Power-Off Mode Eject</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"71","number_of_reviews":"1","category":"A/V Head Units","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"rear AUX port is ideal for connecting random portable devices while keeping them hidden","id":"109112","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"picks up faint FM signals reliably, great for getting stations from distant markets","id":"109114","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"color is very striking and unique","id":"109117","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"remote control is compact and durable, perfect for attaching to a keychain","id":"109118","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"display can be adjusted to any lighting, don't have to worry about the sun","id":"109121","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"functions are a little complicated to learn, takes some time","id":"109113","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"remote design is bulky and awkward, doesn't match the stereo","id":"109120","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[{"url":"http://www.productwiki.com/jvc-kd-r520/","id":51148,"title":"JVC KD-R520","description":"<p>The JVC KD-R520 is a low-cost car CD receiver.
