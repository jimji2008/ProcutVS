The 32 inch screen has a native resolution of 1280x720, ensuring that 720p video will be displayed without any distortion or black bars on the sides. A refresh rate of 60Hz is used which is adequate for most general purpose viewing, and Dynamic Noise Reduction applies noise reduction to areas that it detects interference in the signal. DynaLight enables the screen to automatically get brighter or dimmer depending on the room's ambient lighting, and a Gaming Mode is available to minimize lag between movements at the controller and updates on the screen. The built-in tuner can process digital signals in NTSC, ATSC and QAM formats.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>32 in LCD widescreen</li>\n    <li>Up to 720p HD</li>\n    <li>Native Display Resolution: 1280x720</li>\n    <li>Refresh Rate: 60Hz</li>\n    <li>DynaLight</li>\n    <li>Gaming Mode</li>\n    <li>Dynamic Noise Reduction</li>\n    <li>Tuner: NTSC/ATSC/QAM in the Clear</li>\n    <li>2 x HDMI, Component, PC, USB inputs</li>\n    <li>VESA mount compatible</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"-1","number_of_reviews":"0","category":"LCD TVs","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":null,"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Toshiba 32C110","upc":"022265004258","mpn":"32C110","asin":"B004MFDKZQ","ean":"022265004258"}]}]}
