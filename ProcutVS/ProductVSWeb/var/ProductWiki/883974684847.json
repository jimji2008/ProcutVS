Designed almost exclusively for business and education purposes, the Toshiba L655-S5150 houses a fast dual-core Pentium processor (2.13GHz), 4GB of DDR3 RAM, and a 320GB hard drive. Unlike some of its counterparts (e.g., L655-S5105, L655-S5105), the Satellite L655-S5150 doesn&rsquo;t offer an HDMI output. It does however feature a 720p compliant display, meaning it can be used to watch some high-definition videos. On the business end, the L655-S5150 laptop comes with Ethernet, WiFi, and even a webcam, which can of course be used for video conferencing with business associates. Plus the battery is rated at 5 hours, though professionals who like to run many simultaneous apps may end up running out of juice within 4 hours.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Windows 7 OS</li>\n    <li>Intel Pentium P6200</li>\n    <li>Mobile Intel HD Graphics</li>\n    <li>4GB DDR3 RAM</li>\n    <li>320GB HDD (5400rpm)</li>\n    <li>DVD SuperMulti</li>\n    <li>15.6&quot; Widescreen LCD</li>\n    <li>720p Video Resolution</li>\n    <li>Built-In Webcam/Microphone</li>\n    <li>Standard Stereo Speakers</li>\n    <li>802.11b/g/n Wireless</li>\n    <li>10/100 Ethernet</li>\n    <li>6-Cell Li-Ion Battery</li>\n    <li>Microphone/Headphone Ports</li>\n    <li>Memory Card Reader</li>\n    <li>USB 2.0 x2</li>\n    <li>eSATA/USB</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"71","number_of_reviews":"1","category":"Misc Laptops","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"built wide for a full keyboard, comfortable to work with","id":"86323","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"playback of videos is in true high-definition widescreen 720p, no distortion or black bars","id":"86324","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"runs applications fast, can handle as many windows as you need without bogging down","id":"86325","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"reasonably light and easy to carry around for the size","id":"86327","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"speakers are reasonably loud, good enough for most basic things","id":"86329","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"shows all fingerprints, needs fairly regular cleaning","id":"86326","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"ships with a collection of software of limited appeal that needs to be unloaded for efficient operation","id":"86328","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Toshiba Satellite L655-S5150","upc":"883974684847","mpn":"L655-S5150","asin":"B004IOWNDG","ean":"883974684847"}]}]}
