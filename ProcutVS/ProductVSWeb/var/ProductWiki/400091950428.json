The biggest changes over the first version is the addition of 3G high-speed data access, which Apple claims is over two times faster than the original when accessing the Internet, and the addition of Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities. Outside of these changes, most of the unit remains the same as the previous, with the same touch screen, camera and memory sizes. The original iPhone 3G is the predecessor to the faster <a href=\"http://www.productwiki.com/iphone-3gs/\">iPhone 3GS</a>.</p>\n<h2>Specs</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>3.5&quot; multi-touch screen</li>\n    <li>480x320 resolution with 163ppi</li>\n    <li>WiFi B/G access</li>\n    <li>UTMS, and HSDPA connectivity (GSM only)</li>\n    <li>Bluetooth 2.0</li>\n    <li>2MP camera</li>\n    <li>Assisted GPS</li>\n    <li><b>Battery</b>: 10hrs 2G talk | 5 hours 3G talk | 5hrs 3G Data | 6hrs Wi-Fi | 7hrs video | 24hrs audio | 300hrs standby</li>\n    <li><b>Price</b>: $99 for 8GB | $199 for 16GB. Contract required.</li>\n    <li>UK Price: &pound;Free on 24 Month contract with O2 - Works out to be approx &pound;800-&pound;900 lifetime cost.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Difference between iPhone 2G and iPhone 3G</h2>\n<p><b>3G support</b> - when accessing the data network the data transfer speeds are substantially faster (over twice as fast according to Apple).</p>\n<p><b>GPS</b> - the iPhone 2G had basic location finding that was accurate to hundreds of meters, while the iPhone 3G's implementation is accurate to a few feet for most locations. Additionally, the iPhone 3G renders your position in real time.</p>\n<p><b>Case design</b> - the iPhone 3G is slightly thicker at 12.3mm versus the 2G's 11.6mm. The 3G uses a plastic backing instead of brushed metal like on the 2G, and now the iPhone's headphone jack is &quot;flush&quot; which lets you use regular headphones without the need for an adapter.</p>\n<h2>iPhone 3.0 Software Additions</h2>\n<p><strong>Push Notifications</strong> - you can now be notified by an Application even if it's not currently running. However the notifications are limited to simple status messages and is not full background processing like the Palm Pre is capable of doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Copy-and-Paste</strong> - cut, copy and paste text between different applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Undo/Redo</strong> -&nbsp;Shake the phone to undo/redo when using certain applications like Notes.</p>\n<p><strong>Improved Calendar support</strong> - Calendar application supports more formats now including the ics standard to sync with Google and Yahoo Calendar services.</p>\n<p><strong>Landscape keyboard</strong> - now the landscape keyboard is available in all applications, including e-mail.</p>\n<p><strong>Search</strong> - the core Apple applications now have search built-in so you can search through the text. This includes searching through e-mails and the note applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Spotlight</strong> - on the left-most pane of the icon screen is now a search utility that lets you search through most of the major Apple applications, and the application names themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>MMS</strong> - now you can send pictures, voice, and other rich data through the SMS system.</p>\n<h2>iPhone 2.0 Software Additions</h2>\n<p><b>Enterprise Features</b> - supports VPNs, Exchange Server, remote wiping, expanded documents compatibility (Powerpoint now supported, iWorks support). No document editing supported. Documents can now be viewed in horizontal screen aspect by turning the iPhone on its side. These software features are also available on the first gen iPhone.</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>saves images in e-mails to photo library</li>\n    <li>bulk delete and move</li>\n    <li>contact search</li>\n    <li>more language support</li>\n    <li>parental controls</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>App Store</h2>\n<p>iPod Touch and iPhone owners can download new applications and programs developed for the devices from the official App Store. Any 3rd party can develop and publish applications to the App Store and can set the price to anything they want, with Apple getting 30% of the revenue. Unofficial applications have already been created for the iPhone 2G, so Apple is hoping that official support and distribution for 3rd party apps will allow for an improved application ecosystem. The App Store can be accessed from the iPhone itself, or from iTunes.</p>","proscore":"49","number_of_reviews":"90","category":"Smart Phones","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"GPS Support","id":"8244","score":"55","submitter":false},{"text":"Good selection of free apps available","id":"9306","score":"44","submitter":false},{"text":"High speed 3G","id":"8243","score":"42","submitter":false},{"text":"Intuitive interface","id":"9307","score":"37","submitter":false},{"text":"Still has the best web browser on a cell phone","id":"8251","score":"34","submitter":false},{"text":"Very vibrant developer community","id":"8245","score":"32","submitter":false},{"text":"Real time 3D graphic rendering","id":"8770","score":"25","submitter":false},{"text":"WiFi","id":"20407","score":"24","submitter":false},{"text":"Very responsive touchscreen","id":"16097","score":"21","submitter":false},{"text":"Slimmer contour than previous generation","id":"9316","score":"18","submitter":false},{"text":"Excellent free development tools and documentation.","id":"11481","score":"17","submitter":false},{"text":"Purchasing of music and apps right on the phone","id":"20344","score":"17","submitter":false},{"text":"Desktop synchronisation with both MacOS X and Windows ","id":"11482","score":"15","submitter":false},{"text":"Operating system years ahead of competitors.","id":"11480","score":"14","submitter":false},{"text":"YouTube","id":"20345","score":"14","submitter":false},{"text":"Largest screen on a phone","id":"20346","score":"14","submitter":false},{"text":"Quality controlled third party applications","id":"11484","score":"10","submitter":false},{"text":"text selection, cut, copy and paste functionality (added in 3.0)","id":"20382","score":"10","submitter":false},{"text":"Easily email and post photos to Facebook directly from the phone\n","id":"23328","score":"10","submitter":false},{"text":"Viable Gameing Platform","id":"31038","score":"8","submitter":false},{"text":"Integrated (via Google app) voice search is great.","id":"24676","score":"7","submitter":false},{"text":"MMS capabilities (added in 3.0)","id":"20383","score":"6","submitter":false},{"text":"Push synchronisation via me.com","id":"11483","score":"4","submitter":false},{"text":"Cars now feature a digital iPod connector for crystal-clear digital interfacing","id":"20347","score":"4","submitter":false},{"text":"MMS available in OS 3.0 or above","id":"37496","score":"3","submitter":false},{"text":"Tethering available with OS3.0 or above","id":"37495","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Camera functionality has improved surprisingly much with software updates (3.x)","id":"48050","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Available in white (16 GB version only)","id":"8250","score":"-17","submitter":false},{"text":"Affordable (depending on service plan)","id":"8246","score":"-18","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"Can't replace the battery yourself, can't replace with a \"spare\"","id":"8730","score":"32","submitter":false},{"text":"Crippled Bluetooth (only hands-free devices supported)","id":"8882","score":"28","submitter":false},{"text":"Battery life is disappointing \nwhen using 3G","id":"8729","score":"26","submitter":false},{"text":"Camera didn't get improved","id":"8247","score":"25","submitter":false},{"text":"When switching applications from within another application (ie. sending an email while on map), it doesn't return you to your original app","id":"9373","score":"25","submitter":false},{"text":"Hitting back button in Safari forces the page to reload which is slow","id":"9734","score":"24","submitter":false},{"text":"Map driving directions are text only (no audio)","id":"8961","score":"22","submitter":false},{"text":"Turn by turn directions in Google Maps app isn't fully flushed out","id":"9374","score":"17","submitter":false},{"text":"No built-in tethering solution for Internet sharing with a laptop","id":"8962","score":"15","submitter":false},{"text":"No map-caching for the default maps application, so if you don't have a strong signal, you get slow performance or a blank map","id":"9730","score":"12","submitter":false},{"text":"Very quiet speakerphone","id":"9847","score":"11","submitter":false},{"text":"No improvement in storage","id":"8248","score":"10","submitter":false},{"text":"No text selection or copy/paste functionality.","id":"8312","score":"9","submitter":false},{"text":"Cannot shuffle between apps","id":"20368","score":"8","submitter":false},{"text":"No front-facing camera lens for video chat","id":"8249","score":"6","submitter":false},{"text":"no Adobe Flash support","id":"42910","score":"6","submitter":false},{"text":"camera is only 2MP","id":"42906","score":"5","submitter":false},{"text":"No voice dialing.","id":"24677","score":"4","submitter":false},{"text":"No background running apps","id":"30848","score":"4","submitter":false},{"text":"On AT&T service only.

With this iteration Apple responds to many of their critics in incorporating application multitasking and background processing. However, in true Apple fashion, they have devised their own take on these features that they claim preserves battery life and responsiveness while offering the ability to run and switch between multiple applications. This differs from a typical multi-tasking implementation as Apple created seven new services that the OS can run in the background and that 3rd party apps have access to, but the actual 3rd party apps are paused and resumed rather than concurrently executed. Alongside multitasking Apple introduces some other major functionality in iPhone OS 4, including a comprehensive gaming social network akin to Xbox Live, and a rich integrated ad platform called iAd. It must be noted that some functions such as multitasking are not compatible with iPhone versions older than the 3GS.</p>\n<h2>Additions with this Release</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>limited background processing\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>background audio</strong> - for apps like Pandora and Last.fm stream music while using other applications</li>\n        <li><strong>Voice over IP</strong> - for apps like Skype receive calls even when it's not open</li>\n        <li><strong>Background location</strong> - for apps like Loopt to automatically update your location</li>\n        <li><strong>Push notifications</strong></li>\n        <li><strong>Local notifications</strong></li>\n        <li><strong>Task completion</strong> - for apps like flickr to continue uploading a photo even after the app is closed</li>\n        <li><strong>Fast app switching</strong></li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>change your homescreen wallpaper</li>\n    <li>homescreen folders\n    <ul>\n        <li>drag and drop apps on top of one another to automatically create app group folders</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>enhanced mail app\n    <ul>\n        <li>unifies inboxes</li>\n        <li>view e-mails as conversations</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>enhanced enterprise features</li>\n    <li>cross game mobile social network (a la Xbox Live)\n    <ul>\n        <li>matchmaking</li>\n        <li>achievements</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>iAd\n    <ul>\n        <li>in-app advertising platform that's run on the OS level.

Switching between applications is accomplished through a mini-dock that comes up when you press the home button twice.</p>\n<p>While programs are running in the background they have access to a limited set of core functionality. Specifically they can play music, start or continue Voice over IP calls, update location information, display notifications, and complete started tasks. Apple claims that these services will provide the key functionality that people want from the apps while not compromising battery life or performance.</p>\n<h2>iAd</h2>\n<p>The iAd platform is part of the core operating system. This means that apps can have rich, interactive advertisements that don't require you to leave the app. Apple claims that this will let people engage with the ads better, which will let developers monetize off their free applications better. The hope for end users is that there will be even more, and better quality free apps.</p>","proscore":"65","number_of_reviews":"17","category":null,"key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"smart multitasking lets you have multiple applications running while preserving battery life","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"folders are useful","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"allows users to set their own wallpapers","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"new enterprise features including remote management, wireless app distribution","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Background location updating will let some cool apps be made such as tracking a bike trip","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"new mail app: includes multiple exchange accounts, centrallized inbox, threaded messages, and fast inbox switching","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Game Center could do for mobile games what Xbox Live did for console games","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Good amount of options for managing your location settings","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"still available for older iPhone 3G / iPod Touch 2nd gen - albeit without multitasking (due to slower hardware)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"improved spotlight functionality allows for direct searching of Wikipedia, Google","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"iAd is a brand new form of advertising - could revolutionize ads the same way AdSense did","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"no flash, floppy, or other outdated technology","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"will be available on iPad","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"iAds could make apps become overwhelmed with ads - similar to Made For AdSense sites","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Still no Adobe Flash","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"will inevitably diminish battery life (due to improved multitasking functionality)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Multitasking won't be supported on the iPhone 3G/iPod Touch 2nd Gen and older platforms","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"won't be available for the iPad until the fall - where multitasking is needed most","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"not true multitasking - but app switching, applications are 'paused' besides a few key tricks like background VOIP, audio playback, location data","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"no background images for iPhone 3G","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"upgrade can take a LONG time","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"no multi/centrallized notification area","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"no audio profiles for different volume/ring settings for different environments","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"even more restrictive NDA license agreement: limits devs to 3 languages, bans cross-platform dev tools, bans use of 3rd party APIs and frameworks","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"No custom sms ringtones","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"concurrent apps can be closed by the iPhone OS whenever it thinks it's \"necessary\" - user doesn't have full control","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Background location is scary from a privacy perspective","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Having to listen to a lot of 'analysts' about what iPad  'may', 'could', 'won't' and 'will inevitably' do","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false}]},"reviews":null,"tags":null,"competitors":null,"related":null,"skus":null},{"url":"http://www.productwiki.com/apple-ipad/","id":35352,"title":"Apple iPad","description":"<p>The Apple iPad is a device that has a lot in common with tablet computers but also introduces a new classification of products with its April 3, 2010 release. The intention of the device is to offer a new, comprehensive approach to interacting with many functions and services that are served by several currently existing products; <strong>Apple</strong> also intends for the <strong>iPad</strong> to bring similar sweeping, revolutionary changes to portable computing that the iPod brought for the music industry. The <strong>iPad</strong> makes itself unique from other devices in three main ways: a multi-touch display, an ultra-slim design, and a custom built, reimagined intuitive user interface. The display on the system is capable of real-time configuration between landscape and portrait orientations by automatically detecting how the user is holding the device. The system is also designed to be virtually button-free, with a multi-touch, 9.7 inch LCD with in-plane switching (IPS) and LED backlight for bright, vibrant displays with large viewing angles.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>iPad</strong>&nbsp;focuses on being highly portable with a depth of only&nbsp;half an inch, a weight of only&nbsp;1.5 lbs&nbsp;and, due to the&nbsp;1GHz Apple A4 processor, an in-use&nbsp;battery life of up to 10 hours&nbsp;in order to last an entire day before needing to be charged.</p>\n<p>The multi-touch display also means that the <strong>iPad</strong> is capable of recognizing multiple inputs--multiple fingertips--from the user at once for a smoother, more intuitive and responsive interface during all interaction with the device, including a full QWERTY onscreen keyboard. The menus and applications used have also been either redesigned or tailored specifically for optimal use with the <strong>iPad</strong>, including updated and customized versions of internet browsers, email clients, picture albums, iTunes, iBooks, and video displays. Most applications have been altered to take advantage of the larger screen and also to function exclusively with the touch interface. In terms of hardware the system has much in common with an all-in-one desktop computer but with all of the portability of a netbook.

The iPhone boasts an impressive list of features and specifications and is summed up in 3 ways: iPod + cell phone + Internet connectivity. Any traditional forms of interacting with mobile devices has been stripped away to leave room for one large touchscreen. The first generation iPhone has been superceded by the <a href=\"http://www.productwiki.com/iphone-3g/\">iPhone 3G</a>, and more recently the <a href=\"http://www.productwiki.com/apple-iphone-3gs/\">iPhone 3GS</a> which most adds 3G network support and GPS functionality in a slightly smaller form factor.</p>\n<p>Interaction is achieved through touching the screen, not with a stylus, but with fingers. This has allowed Apple to create more advanced forms of touch interaction that includes multi-point gestures (for example, zoom in on a section of a web-page by pinching the screen with 2 fingers).</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>accelerometer (to detect orientation)</li>\n    <li>Wi-Fi</li>\n    <li>Bluetooth</li>\n    <li>stripped down version of OSX</li>\n    <li>iPod music, video and picture playback</li>\n    <li>touch-screen based controls</li>\n    <li>proximity sensor so screen and headphone audio turn off when device is brought to your face</li>\n    <li>intuitive phone systems for calling and managing address book</li>\n    <li>A ton of PDA software</li>\n    <li>web browser, Google maps, full POP and IMAP e-mail support</li>\n    <li>syncs with iTunes</li>\n    <li>glass surface to reduce smears and scratches</li>\n    <li><b>8GB</b> - $399 | <b>16GB</b> - $499</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the iPhone first launched there were two versions available, but due to strongly slanted sales the 4GB version has been discontinued with the <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">8GB</span> retailing for <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">$399</span>.

This allows people to purchase and download music directly from their iPhone without a computer. Purchased music automatically syncs with your computer when the iPhone is reconnected.</p>\n<p>iPhone users are also given an extra option in the iTMS through the purchase of custom ring tones. Ring tones can be purchased for 99 cents on top of the price of the song. If you already own the song then you only have to pay an extra 99 cents, but if you don't then you have to purchase both for $1.98. The ring tones are not premade, instead you can create your own snippet of the song to use as a ring tone at a maximum length of 30 seconds.

The major upgrades from the <a href=\"http://www.productwiki.com/apple-iphone-3gs/\">iPhone 3GS</a> are the changed form factor (thinner design), 4x higher resolution, front facing camera for video chat, and upgraded camera system with 5MP photos, and HD recording. Apple touts the largest upgrade with the new video chat features, however there are currently severe limitations to the service that they are calling &quot;FaceTime&quot;. Most notably, video chat only works between iPhone 4 devices, and it requires a WiFi connection. Its new processor is an ARM Cortex A8 (ARMv7 ISA) that was developed by  Intrinsity and Samsung in 2009, and is either known as the Samsung  S5PC110 &quot;Hummingbird&quot; or the Apple A4 (the only difference being the integrated PowerVR hardware graphics accelerator by Imagination Technologies). This line of processors is used in the <a href=\"../../apple-ipad/\">Apple iPad</a>, <a href=\"http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/06/01/samsung-to-double-androids-global-footprint/\">Samsung  Galaxy S</a>&nbsp;series phones, and Samsung Galaxy Tab.</p>\n<p>Other upgrades place the iPhone 4 among the best in class in the <a href=\"http://www.productwiki.com/smart-phones/\">smartphone</a> category. The display is the highest resolution available on any smartphone (as of June 2010), it is one of the only phones that can do HD video recording of 720p at 30FPS, and the added gyrosensor gives the software total awareness of the phone's spatial orientation. Among all of these improvements Apple has also been able to reduce the size of the phone compared to the 3GS and increase the battery life by 40%.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>9.33mm thick - 24% thinner than iPhone 3GS<b><br />\n    </b></li>\n    <li>the band that forms the structure of the phone is also the antenna</li>\n    <li>Cortex A8 based ARM processor (Apple A4 / Samsung Hummingbird)</li>\n    <li>Dual mic noise suppression</li>\n    <li>802.11n WiFi</li>\n    <li>Improved 6-axis motion sensing with the addition of a gyrosensor</li>\n    <li><strong>Hardware features</strong>\n    <ul>\n        <li>front facing camera</li>\n        <li>micro&nbsp;SIM</li>\n        <li>camera and LED&nbsp;flash on the back</li>\n        <li>mute, volume up, volume down on the side</li>\n        <li>headset, 2nd mic&nbsp;for noise cancelling, and sleep wake button</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Improved display</strong>\n    <ul>\n        <li>3.5 inch display</li>\n        <li>Retina display - 4x the density of pixels - 326 pixels per inch</li>\n        <li>960x640 display</li>\n        <li>800:1 contrast ratio</li>\n        <li>IPS technology (same as iPad)</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Improved battery over 3GS</strong>\n    <ul>\n        <li>7 hours of 3G talk</li>\n        <li>6 hours of 3G browsing</li>\n        <li>10 hours of WiFi browsing</li>\n        <li>10 hours of video</li>\n        <li>40 hours of music</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Quad-band HSDPA/HSUPA</strong>\n    <ul>\n        <li>7.2Mbps down</li>\n        <li>5.8 Mbps up</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Improved camera system</strong>\n    <ul>\n        <li>5MP (up from 3MP)</li>\n        <li>5x digital zoom</li>\n        <li>tap to focus</li>\n        <li>LED flash</li>\n        <li>backside illuminated sensor</li>\n        <li>records video at 720p at 30fps</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>FaceTime (video chat)</strong><br />\n    <ul>\n        <li>iPhone 4 to iPhone 4</li>\n        <li>WiFi only</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Models</strong>\n    <ul>\n        <li>16GB for $199 (subsidized with AT&amp;T 2-year contract)</li>\n        <li>32GB for $299 (subsidized with AT&amp;T 2-year contract)</li>\n        <li>both available in white and black</li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>","proscore":"63","number_of_reviews":"63","category":null,"key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"Larger battery","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Flash on rear camera","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"faster processor (Apple/Samsung/Intrinsity A4)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Improved rear camera with larger lens","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Improved screen with much higher resolution (960 x 640px, IPS panel - highest pixel density of any phone)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"720p video recording","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"24% thinner than the previous generation iPhone (9.33mm)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"now includes gyroscope for full 6-axis motion sensing","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Front-facing camera (0.3MP)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Active noise cancellation with dedicated mic.","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"includes iOS (iPhone OS 4) - OS can run up to 7 core OS services in the background (Apple's approximation of multi-tasking)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"a worthy update - much nicer than the 3G to 3GS upgrade","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"200000 Third party apps available and counting!","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"slick industrial design looks a lot nicer than the previous generation phones - aesthetically similar to the iPad, iMac and Macbook Pro lines","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Available on a wide range of Canadian carriers","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"capable of full video chat via Apple's new FaceTime service (WiFi only for 2010)","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Facetime is now available on the new iPod touch and compatible with iPhone 4!","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"jailbreak is legal!","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"In most countries and in the EU, Apple allows you to purchase the phone unlocked.

This operating system did not have an official name until the release of the first beta version of the iPhone SDK on March 6, 2008. Before then, Apple marketing literature simply stated that the &quot;iPhone uses OS X,&quot; a reference to Apple's desktop operating system, Mac OS X. iPhone OS has four abstraction layers: the Core OS layer, the Core Services layer, the Media layer, and the Cocoa Touch layer. Some multitasking is permitted, but it is not obtrusive or obvious, and it is limited to Apple's own applications. OpenGL ES is used as graphics API. As of Nov. 4, 2009, there are over 100,000 applications officially available for the iPhone, and 2 billion downloads had been achieved. On September 9, 2009, Apple announced version 3.1 of the iPhone OS.</p>","proscore":"77","number_of_reviews":"6","category":null,"key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"mature application store","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"multi-touch user interface","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Open GL ES as graphics API","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"intuitive user-interface","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"OS updates itself often","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"integration with iTunes","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"A centralised Application store makes it easy to find, compare and install the right applications.","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Device is backed up every time it is synced, with encrypted backups available to protect personal data.","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Excellent developer tools available free to download.","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Excellent music and video player built in","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Screen input turns off automatically when the phone is in the pocket, making it nearly impossible to accidentally place a call.","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Virtual keyboard makes it easy to switch between different languages, you are not stuck with QWERTY.","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"OS is used by an increasing number of different devices with iPhones, iPod touch and now the iPad supported.","id":null,"score":null,"submitter":false},{"text":"Metadata like phone numbers and addresses is automatically detected and made ready for interaction.
