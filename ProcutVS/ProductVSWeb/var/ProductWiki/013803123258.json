This is similar to the Canon PIXMA MG8120, but has a 3.0 inch LCD display and doesn't scan negatives. Apart from that they are the same, with the capability of printing at a 9600x2400 dpi in color using 6 individual ink tanks for better color accuracy. Borderless prints on photo paper can last up to 300 years without fading when stored in archival albums. Interaction with the unit's functions are handled through a series of touch-sensitive controls and a scroll wheel to quickly select applicable options. A number of automated processes help make printing much easier, including Auto Photo Fix II for making portraits look better and Auto Document Fix for ensuring that text is as clear or clearer than the original.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>9600 x 2400 maximum colour dpi</li>\n    <li>6 individual ink tank system</li>\n    <li>Borderless printing</li>\n    <li>Photos last up to 300 years when stored properly</li>\n    <li>Touch sensitive controls, scroll wheel</li>\n    <li>3.0 in LCD</li>\n    <li>Full HD Movie Print</li>\n    <li>Built-in Auto Duplexing</li>\n    <li>Auto Photo Fix II</li>\n    <li>Auto Document Fix</li>\n    <li>Auto Scan Mode</li>\n    <li>Quick Start</li>\n    <li>2-Way Paper Feeding</li>\n    <li>WiFi, LAN, USB, PictBridge, Smartphone, and Memory Card printing</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"92","number_of_reviews":"1","category":"Printers","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"Gorgeous piece of hardware","id":"95319","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Wireless b,g,n certified","id":"95320","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Fairly large flip-up display","id":"95321","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Reasonably compact for an all-in-one printer","id":"95322","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Quiet and quick printing operation","id":"95326","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Quickly prints photos with superb quality","id":"95327","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"9600 dpi!!","id":"95328","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Scroll wheel and light-up touch capacitive controls make for a very slick, high-tech look.","id":"95329","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"clever led indicator lights up when ink tanks are properly installed ","id":"95333","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Auto duplexing","id":"95334","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"Six individual ink tanks for color accuracy- one black ink and 5 dye-based:cyan, yellow, magenta, grey, and black","id":"95335","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"Gorgeous black case is a magnet for fingerprints and dust.","id":"95324","score":"1","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Canon PIXMA MG6120","upc":"013803123258","mpn":"4503B002","asin":"B003YL412U","ean":"013803123258"}]}]}
