Available for iPhones, Blackberry, and Android phones, the SmartStart app lets users lock/unlock their car, arm/disarm the security system, pop the trunk, turn on the panic alarm, pre-arm or pre-cool it, or start up the engine from anywhere in the world. Plus users can even control multiple cars. However, for the system to work the user must have cellular or WiFi service, and the associated vehicle must be in a location where it has a cellular signal as well&mdash;as the system runs on the AT&amp;T network. Most coveted by users is the system&rsquo;s ability to send alerts to the user whenever there is an alarm activation.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Mobile Application</li>\n    <li>Designed for Viper Systems</li>\n    <li>Supports Remote-Alarm Systems</li>\n    <li>Supports Security Systems</li>\n    <li>Multiple Cars</li>\n    <li>Full System Access</li>\n    <li>Alarm Activation Notice</li>\n    <li>Available for iPhone, BlackBerry, Android</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Model Variations</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Viper SmartStart for iPhone | Requires iPhone OS 3.0+ ; iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad Compatible</li>\n    <li>Viper SmartStart for BlackBerry | Supports all BlackBerry Devices &amp; All Carriers</li>\n    <li>Viper SmartStart for Android | Supports all Google Android Smartphones</li>\n</ul>","proscore":"75","number_of_reviews":"2","category":"Remote Car Starters","key_features":[],"images":[],"proscons":{"pros":[{"text":"iPhone interface looks sleek and stays secure","id":"68849","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"2-way confirmation of all commands received at the vehicle","id":"68850","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"an alert displays if the command wasn't received by the car","id":"68851","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"some personalization options available for different models of vehicle","id":"68852","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"app is passcode protected, feature can be turned off if desired","id":"68853","score":"1","submitter":false},{"text":"auditory feedback plays whenever a button is pushed so that you know a command was given","id":"68854","score":"1","submitter":false}],"cons":[{"text":"works inconsistently, often have to send the command a few times to start the car","id":"68847","score":"2","submitter":false}]},"reviews":[],"tags":[],"competitors":[],"related":[],"skus":[{"title":"Viper SmartStart | Smartphone","upc":"093207074646","mpn":"VSS4000","asin":"B002WDGW4Q","ean":"093207074646"},{"title":"Viper SmartStart | Blackberry","upc":null,"mpn":null,"asin":"B003GLQB5I","ean":null}]}]}
