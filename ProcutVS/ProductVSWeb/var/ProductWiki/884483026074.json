This system will run most applications, but gaming enthusiasts will want a more powerful CPU and GPU. It features an AMD Turion II X2 Dual-Core processor running at 2.4 GHz, and works with 4Gb of DDR3 memory that is shared with the graphics processor. An integrated ATI Radeon HD 4250 graphics processor is integrated, and uses up to 256 MB of memory. While high definition audio is supported, the 500GB of hard drive space may be inadequate for home theater PC use. WiFi and 10/100/1000 Ethernet are built in, and a 1.3 Megapixel webcam is integrated.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>AMD Turion II X2 Dual-Core Processor P540</li>\n    <li>2.4GHz, 1066MHz FSB, 2MB L2 Cache</li>\n    <li>Operating System: Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit)</li>\n    <li>Memory: 4096MB Dual-Channel DDR3 1066MHz Memory</li>\n    <li>Hard Drive: 500GB 5400RPM SATA hard drive</li>\n    <li>Color: Wave Pattern Case Design with Velvet Blue Lid</li>\n    <li>ATI Radeon HD 4250 Graphics with up to 256MB of dedicated system memory</li>\n    <li>Shader Model 4.0 and&nbsp;Microsoft DirectX 10.1 with AMD M880G Chipset</li>\n    <li>802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 port)</li>\n    <li>8x DVD-Super Multi Double-Layer Drive</li>\n    <li>Battery Life: Up to 3.7-hours</li>\n    <li>Social Media Key and Dedicated Numeric Keypad</li>\n    <li>Display: 15.6 in HD Widescreen Ultrabright TFT LCD Display (1366 x 768 resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio)</li>\n    <li>3 x USB 2.0, VGA Port, HDMI Port</li>\n    <li>Multi-in-1 Digital Media Card Reader</li>\n    <li>High-Definition Audio Support, Built-In speakers, microphone, headphone/Speaker/Line-Out Jack</li>\n    <li>1 Year Parts and Labor Limited Warranty</li>\n    <li>Built-In 1.3MP Webcam (1280 x 1024)</li>\n    <li>Weight:&nbsp;5.72 lbs.
